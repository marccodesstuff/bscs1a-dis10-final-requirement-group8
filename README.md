## **Description**

Guess the Words is a "Family Feud" like game but you play it alone (and with a different set of rules through elimination). As the player of this game, all that you have to do is enter a keyword based on the (only) question given in the console application. Once you guessed all of the keywords, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose (once you got 3 crosses.).

## **Note**

> The first version of the game has some topics that are covered prior to the FINALS. Those MIDTERM topics are now removed in this version. If you wish to see the first version of this application, please contact Marc Velasquez through Microsoft Teams.

## **Installation**

To operate this program, you need to have an installation of the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> in your local machine. Assuming that you are reading this `README.md` file, you have already extracted the contents of this Java project. To run the program, use your system terminal application and head to the project directory from there. Once you're in the project directory, use the following command:

`java game`

This should run the application.
